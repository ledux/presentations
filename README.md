# Presentations

These are my presentations I held in various situations

## Build the presentations

The presentations are written in markdown.
They can be transformed into a pdf using [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/demos.html).

There is a script for doing that, using [the docker image of pandoc](https://pandoc.org/installing.html#docker)

```sh
./build-presentation dynamodb/presentation-dynamodb.md
```
